## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test USB Connection
1. Plug in FNB58 via USB
2. Run: `python start.py`
3. Open browser to http://localhost:5001
4. Click "Connect (Auto)" or "USB"
5. Should see live data!

### Test Bluetooth Connection (Your Device)
1. Turn on FNB58 Bluetooth
2. Go to Settings page
3. Click "Scan for Bluetooth Devices"
4. Select your device
5. Return to Dashboard
6. Click "Bluetooth"
7. Should see live data wirelessly!

1. Connect device
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Do something (charge phone, etc.)
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Go to History
6. View your session!

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Easy Wins
- Change color scheme in `style.css`
- Add your logo to navigation
- Customize decimal places in settings
- Add more chart types

### Medium Effort
- Add alert thresholds
- Email notifications
- Database storage (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Multi-device support
- Protocol detection display

### Advanced
- Cloud sync
- Mobile native app
- Desktop app (Electron)
- Automated testing

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Bluetooth limited data** - BT only sends V/A/W, not D+/D-/Temp
2. **No protocol triggering** - Can't trigger QC/PD modes (yet!)
3. **Local only** - Not cloud-connected (feature, not bug!)
4. **Single device** - Can't monitor multiple FNB58s simultaneously (yet!)

## 📊 Performance

- **USB**: 100Hz sample rate, ~400 samples/second (4 per packet)
- **Bluetooth**: ~10Hz sample rate
- **Chart update**: Throttled to 60fps for smooth animation
- **Memory**: Keeps last 10,000 points in memory
- **Export**: Can handle sessions with 1M+ samples

## 🚀 Deployment Options
